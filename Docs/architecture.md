# HealthCare MVP Architecture

## 1. Purpose

HealthCare is a multi-clinic healthcare platform where a patient creates one global account and can discover and book appointments with multiple independent clinics or hospitals.

The platform must provide a unified patient experience while maintaining strict privacy between clinics.

Example:

- The patient registers once using Google or email.
- The patient can see Clinic A, Clinic B, and other available clinics.
- The patient can book a dental appointment at Clinic A.
- The same patient can later book dialysis treatment at Clinic B.
- The patient can see their own records from both clinics.
- Clinic A must never see Clinic B's private records.
- Clinic B must never see Clinic A's private records.

This document defines the MVP architecture and the rules Cursor must follow when generating code.

## 2. Architecture principles

The MVP must follow these principles:

1. Use a modular monolith, not microservices.
2. Use one ASP.NET Core API.
3. Use one PostgreSQL database.
4. Keep modules logically separated.
5. Use one global patient identity.
6. Create a separate clinic-patient relationship for each clinic.
7. Store `ClinicId` on every clinic-owned record.
8. Enforce clinic isolation in application logic, authorization, tests, and database constraints.
9. Enforce patient self-scope so a patient can access only records linked to their own patient account.
10. Prefer simple, common, well-documented .NET patterns because Cursor will perform most implementation work.
11. Do not introduce unnecessary technologies during the MVP.

## 6. Domain model

### 6.1 Global identity model

A user is a global platform identity.

```text
ApplicationUser
├── Id
├── Email
├── NormalizedEmail
├── PhoneNumber
├── IsActive
├── CreatedAtUtc
└── UpdatedAtUtc
```

A patient account is linked to one global user.

```text
Patient
├── Id
├── UserId
├── FirstName
├── MiddleName
├── LastName
├── DateOfBirth
├── Gender
├── MobileNumber
├── PreferredLanguage
├── Address
├── EmergencyContact
├── CreatedAtUtc
└── UpdatedAtUtc
```

Do not use email as a primary key. Use UUIDs.

### 6.2 Organization and clinic model

An organization owns one or more clinics.

```text
Organization
├── Id
├── Name
├── Slug
├── Status
├── CreatedAtUtc
└── UpdatedAtUtc

Clinic
├── Id
├── OrganizationId
├── Name
├── Slug
├── Specialty
├── Description
├── Address
├── City
├── PhoneNumber
├── Email
├── IsActive
├── CreatedAtUtc
└── UpdatedAtUtc
```

Even if the MVP starts with one clinic per organization, `Clinic` must remain a separate entity so the system is ready for multiple branches.

### 6.3 Clinic-patient relationship

The `ClinicPatient` entity links one global patient to one clinic.

```text
ClinicPatient
├── Id
├── ClinicId
├── PatientId
├── LocalPatientNumber
├── Status
├── RegisteredAtUtc
└── UpdatedAtUtc
```

Rules:

- One patient can have many `ClinicPatient` records.
- One clinic can have many `ClinicPatient` records.
- A unique constraint must exist on `(ClinicId, PatientId)`.
- A patient must not be registered twice in the same clinic.
- Clinic-specific records reference `ClinicPatientId`.

### 6.4 Staff model

```text
StaffMember
├── Id
├── UserId
├── OrganizationId
├── ClinicId
├── Role
├── JobTitle
├── IsActive
├── CreatedAtUtc
└── UpdatedAtUtc
```

MVP rule:

- A clinic staff member belongs to one clinic.
- Multi-clinic staff assignment can be added later through a separate assignment table.

### 6.5 Appointment model

```text
Appointment
├── Id
├── ClinicId
├── ClinicPatientId
├── DoctorStaffMemberId
├── AppointmentDateUtc
├── DurationMinutes
├── Reason
├── Status
├── PatientNotes
├── CancellationReason
├── CreatedByUserId
├── CreatedAtUtc
└── UpdatedAtUtc
```

Recommended statuses:

```text
Requested
Confirmed
CheckedIn
InProgress
Completed
CancelledByPatient
CancelledByClinic
NoShow
```

### 6.6 Medical note model

```text
MedicalNote
├── Id
├── ClinicId
├── ClinicPatientId
├── AppointmentId
├── CreatedByStaffMemberId
├── NoteType
├── Content
├── IsVisibleToPatient
├── CreatedAtUtc
└── UpdatedAtUtc
```

Medical notes are clinic-private by default.

A patient can see only notes explicitly marked as visible to the patient.

### 6.7 Audit log model

```text
AuditLog
├── Id
├── OrganizationId
├── ClinicId
├── UserId
├── Action
├── EntityType
├── EntityId
├── IpAddress
├── UserAgent
├── MetadataJson
└── CreatedAtUtc
```

Audit logs must be append-only from normal application workflows.

---

## 7. Module boundaries

Use these modules inside the modular monolith:

```text
HealthCare
├── Identity
├── Organizations
├── Clinics
├── Staff
├── Patients
├── Appointments
├── MedicalRecords
├── Notifications
└── Auditing
```

Each module should contain its own:

- Domain entities
- Application services or use cases
- DTOs
- Validators
- Authorization rules
- EF Core configurations
- API endpoints or controllers
- Unit tests
- Integration tests

Avoid direct coupling between modules where possible.

---

## 8. Solution structure

```text
HealthCare/
├── src/
│   ├── HealthCare.Api/
│   ├── HealthCare.Web/
│   ├── HealthCare.Mobile/
│   ├── HealthCare.Domain/
│   ├── HealthCare.Application/
│   ├── HealthCare.Infrastructure/
│   └── HealthCare.Contracts/
├── tests/
│   ├── HealthCare.UnitTests/
│   ├── HealthCare.IntegrationTests/
│   └── HealthCare.ArchitectureTests/
├── docs/
│   ├── architecture.md
│   ├── development-plan.md
│   └── security.md
├── docker-compose.yml
├── .env.example
├── Directory.Build.props
├── HealthCare.sln
└── README.md
```

For the MVP, a layered modular monolith is preferred over separate module projects for every module. Do not over-fragment the solution.

---

## 9. API conventions

- Use `/api/v1/...` routes.
- Use request and response DTOs.
- Never expose EF Core entities directly.
- Use standard HTTP status codes.
- Use Problem Details for errors.
- Use pagination for list endpoints.
- Use UTC for API dates.
- Return correlation IDs for traceability.
- Validate all requests using FluentValidation.

Example routes:

```text
POST   /api/v1/auth/google
POST   /api/v1/auth/login
POST   /api/v1/auth/refresh
POST   /api/v1/auth/logout
GET    /api/v1/clinics
GET    /api/v1/clinics/{clinicId}
GET    /api/v1/clinics/{clinicId}/doctors
POST   /api/v1/appointments
GET    /api/v1/patient/appointments
GET    /api/v1/patient/records
GET    /api/v1/staff/appointments
PATCH  /api/v1/staff/appointments/{id}/status
POST   /api/v1/staff/patients/{clinicPatientId}/medical-notes
```

---

## 10. Authentication flows

### 10.1 Patient Google login

```text
Patient selects Sign in with Google
        |
Google authenticates the patient
        |
API validates the Google identity token
        |
API finds or creates ApplicationUser
        |
API finds or creates Patient
        |
API issues access and refresh tokens
```

### 10.2 Staff login

```text
Staff enters email and password
        |
ASP.NET Core Identity validates credentials
        |
API loads staff role and clinic assignment
        |
API issues access and refresh tokens
```

### 10.3 Token policy

- Access tokens must be short-lived.
- Refresh tokens must be stored hashed.
- Refresh token rotation is required.
- Reuse of an old refresh token must revoke the token family.
- Mobile tokens must be stored using secure platform storage.

---

## 11. Data isolation model

### 11.1 Patient access

A patient can access records only when:

```text
Record.ClinicPatient.PatientId == CurrentPatient.Id
```

### 11.2 Clinic staff access

Clinic staff can access records only when:

```text
Record.ClinicId == CurrentStaff.ClinicId
```

### 11.3 Organization admin access

Organization administrators can manage clinics and staff within their organization.

They do not automatically receive permission to read all clinical notes.

### 11.4 Platform admin access

Platform administrators manage platform configuration and organizations.

They must not receive routine unrestricted medical record access.

Any emergency support access must be explicit and audited.

---

## 12. UI requirements

### 12.1 Staff web application

Use MudBlazor to build:

- Dashboard
- Left navigation drawer
- Top application bar
- Appointment calendar
- Appointment queue
- Patient directory
- Patient profile
- Medical notes screen
- Staff management
- Clinic settings
- Audit log viewer
- Responsive forms and dialogs

### 12.2 Patient mobile application

The patient app should provide:

- Google sign-in
- Clinic discovery
- Search by clinic name, location, and specialty
- Clinic details
- Available doctors
- Appointment booking
- My appointments
- Appointment cancellation
- My clinic records grouped by clinic
- Profile management
- Notifications

Records must be grouped by clinic to avoid confusion.

---

## 13. Background jobs

Use Hangfire for work that must not delay API responses.

MVP jobs:

- Appointment confirmation email
- Appointment confirmation SMS
- Appointment reminder
- Daily clinic appointment summary
- Failed notification retry
- Expired refresh token cleanup

Rules:

- Main booking logic must complete in the API transaction first.
- Background jobs must use record IDs, not large serialized objects.
- Jobs must be idempotent where possible.
- Jobs must re-check current appointment status before sending reminders.
- Failed jobs must be visible in the Hangfire dashboard.
- The Hangfire dashboard must not be publicly accessible.

---

## 14. Logging and observability

Use Serilog with structured logging.

Include:

- Correlation ID
- User ID
- Organization ID where applicable
- Clinic ID where applicable
- Request path
- HTTP status code
- Duration

Never log:

- Passwords
- Access tokens
- Refresh tokens
- Google tokens
- Full medical note contents
- Sensitive patient data unless strictly necessary

---

## 15. Cursor implementation rules

Cursor must follow these rules for every task:

1. Read `architecture.md`, `development-plan.md`, and `security.md` first.
2. Explain the files it intends to modify.
3. Make only changes required for the current phase.
4. Do not redesign approved architecture without explicit instruction.
5. Do not change PostgreSQL to SQL Server.
6. Do not introduce microservices.
7. Do not add unnecessary packages.
8. Use async APIs for database and network operations.
9. Add validation.
10. Add authorization.
11. Add or update tests.
12. Run formatting, build, and tests.
13. Fix failures before stopping.
14. Update documentation when architecture or behavior changes.
15. Never leave placeholder security logic such as `TODO: authorize later`.

---

## 16. Definition of done

A feature is complete only when:

- Code compiles.
- Relevant unit tests pass.
- Relevant integration tests pass.
- Authorization is implemented.
- Organization and clinic isolation are tested.
- Patient self-scope is tested where applicable.
- Validation is implemented.
- Errors use Problem Details.
- Logging is appropriate and does not expose secrets.
- Database migration is included when needed.
- Swagger documentation is updated.
- No unrelated files were changed.
- Documentation is updated when needed.
